1. insights:
   The article attempts to clarify the game frame and strategy frame concepts and makes a strong attempt to characterize and distinguish between them.
   The authors call for comparitive studies and believe that these frames are important and require extensive study. 

3. suggestions for improvement:
   inclusion of actual poll data and sentiment analysis reports that led to the authors making the conclusions they did. I feel that the major part of the paper
   was lacking in actual data and was more of a compilation of the findings of other researchers. Most of the data backed findings were to analyse how the strategy
   frame is being used but not what actually characterises the frame itself. Some more data backing would have highlighted the points better.

5. using these concepts in work and project ideas:
   Implementing and analysing the strategic game frame in the Indian Context. Clips playing the news that use the game-frame view to participants
   to analyse how they percieve the individuals being shown. To ensure lack of political bias in the results, the participants may be shown translated news from
   a different state other than their native state.

   Using natural language processing on news transcripts to characterize objectively what news clips constitute the strategy frame, substance frame and game frame.
   We can use the codes provided by the authors at the end of the article for doing these as they do provide a standardized reference for distinguishing between the
   different types of frames.
